# Perceptron_Learning_Algorithm
This program display the Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA) and visualize the result. It works on MATLAB2021b.

# Brief introduction of PLA
The problem is a binary classification for 2-dimensional linear separable dataset. Given the training data, Our goal is to find the decision boundary.

# Set up
- `N`: number of total data
- `splitRatio`: train-test split ratio

# Experiment result
